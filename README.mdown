Active Model Example
======

Basic usage example of ActiveModel

Core class is a Blog Post model with csv persistence.

We will use Active Model to add validation, serialization, hooks ...

In the end we'll have a CSV to JSON serialiser, JSON to CSV Api, a CSV validator, Observers ...

You don't need no ODBC anymore :)

Disclaimer
======

Those are really quick examples used during a 10 min talk prior to Rails3 beta, this is definitly not production ready and not intended to be ;)
